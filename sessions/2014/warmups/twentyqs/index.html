Is this a game that Ghanaians are familiar with?</p> <p>Play the classic version of it with class, let each student ask a question until all students get a chance or answer guessed.</p> <p>Then look at http://www.20q.net/</p> <p>Ah, the game has been automated. How is that possible? </p> <p>Could you automate the game of 20 questions using control structures such as for, while, if, etc.?</p> <p>What on earth is a artificial neural net (ANN)?</p> <p>Naturally, libraries have been made for it in Python. The best known is <a href="http://pybrain.org/">PyBrain</a>.</p> <p>Neural nets belong to a very specialized branch of computer science called machine learning. ANNs were at first overhyped until their limitations were known. Research, some of it quite successful, is ongoing.</p> </div> </body> </html>
