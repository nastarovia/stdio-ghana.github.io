##Course Content

I thought the course went well. There are plenty of things we would do better if we
taught it again.

###Sessions I thought went well:

- basics - however, we needed an introduction to GitHub and PyCharm BEFORE any syntax
session.
- best practices
- debugging
- flow control
- pyoop
- requirements
- userx
- distributed programming
- testing

###Sessions I think need improvement:

advanced
: this is only the second time students typed code. Do NOT take their
knowledge for granted. Reduce the exercises and have help from more instructors.

pycpp
: I wonder if this session can be shortened to 1 hour to provide students
more time for in-class project work.

pyio
: the students struggled and the instructors were not paying attention
enough to help.

pymp
: Well presented but quite advanced. See pycpp.

reuse
: I think this should come later in the course and have examples of
libraries in python that cover the \"additional\" session requested by students.

tools
: this needs to be FIRST. Also, we provided many tools. I think
\"cheat sheets\" would have helped the students substantially.

##Logistical Issues

I did not have any issues participating in this program as a civilian
instructor. Some other notes:

- The Guest Centre is preferable lodging to the dormitories because black-outs
and water shortages were common in the dorm. Additionally, it has a
back-up generator, more reliable internet, and air conditioning.
- Game night was a large success.
- We had socials most nights. Everyone enjoyed these events. I think we may want
to have two fewer socials to give the instructors/students a bit of a break.
- There were some instructor-team communication issues pre- and during the trip.
Some related to technical items, some philosophical.  In a few instances, these issues
bordered on interfering with delivering the course.
- The use of GitHub was not a challenge for the students
- The use of GitHub was a large challenge for instructors. The next time around
it will be a lot smoother. I strongly recommend that all instructors are
mandated to run identical installations of the operating system on their
personal machines from the beginning. This was the largest hurdle. I edited my
content from 3 different machines [windows 7 desktop (lab), windows 7 laptop
(personal), linux mint 15 desktop (personal)] and all three machines required
different tweaks, commands, etc to access and modify content. I estimate that I
spent at least an equivalent amount of time trying to access the course content
as I spent developing course content. If I could do it again from scratch, like
all research, I would do it 2 to 5 times faster. Ultimately, I do not think
GitHub needs to be removed from the course but I think the instructors, from the
onset, should be more standardized on their approach.
- PyCharm was an invaluable tool for the students; however, the instructors did
not adequately convey the power of the IDE (VCS integration, debugging,
refactoring, etc). This was by design.
- Content (specifically, examples) were created in Ghana during other sessions.
This made it so not all instructors were knowledgable of solutions and could not
help students work through examples.
- The instructors were not involved enough in the project work keeping the
students from going down rabbit holes in their code.
