Worst issue was obtaining the invitation letter in time, but easily addressed for future trips by reviewing the actual Visa application.</p> <p>Should stay at the Guest House rather than the dorms. Dorms had no AC, linens and pillows not provided, and a long walk to the classrooms and dining places, as well as having spotty wireless. They were so large, there was no real benefit for staying in the same location as the students, although obtaining access to the tutor room for social events is still a good idea.</p> <p>Need to have a better plan for exchanging currency. They embassy closed at noon even though we were told 1500. Banks are generally not open on Saturday, and we found out later that they no longer exchanged US dollars. We needed to go to the ForEx Bureau, which worked well although they had a slightly lower exchange rate. If Carl had not had quite a bit of money from the previous year, it would have been tough getting through the weekend. The MaxMart at the Legon Mall would exchange small amounts of currency when you bought something.</p> <p>Highly recommend finding some means of transportation such as authorizing taxis, having a car and driver, etc. Makes it easier to purchase bulk water and eat outside of the Guest House, cafeteria and Tyme Out.</p> <h3 id="other-comments">Other comments</h3> <p>I do not think the use of GitHub, Markdown, and using jekyll to be able to view presentations was beneficial to the students. The majority of my time was spent trying to figure those things out, and not on actual course content.</p> <p>Additionally, several changes were made throughout the process, causing things to not work or view properly, so there was a lot of frustration and time wasted on my end trying to make things function again. Not sure the students gained any additional benefit by using this process over a more traditional means (ie powerpoint). Would recommend that instructors who are not familiar with the Markdown, etc, have other means of generating their presentations.</p> <p>Also several presentations were not completed and or smoothed over before we left (I was guilty of this as well). Which made it difficult to look at each others lectures and try to incorporate ideas or tie in the lessons to each other. Then with the poor wireless in the classroom, the possibility for "lights out" it was difficult to commit changes quickly, sync to the local repository, etc. Recommend future instructors keep in mind the screen in the classroom is very small, so small font or lots of text is unreadable from the back of the classroom.</p> <p>It is good to keep the presentations available to students on their computers so they can follow and read.</p> <p>For socials, I think only 2 a week would be sufficient. Movie night is a good idea, but need to have movies downloaded before leaving the US since even wired internet is very slow. Game night was also a big hit. Would not recommend the cook out again since there really is no easy way to cook. Football was also fun, but need to make sure there is a ball. The weekend trip is a great idea and went well.</p> </div> </body> </html>
