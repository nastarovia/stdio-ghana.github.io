##Course content

###Overall recommendations

I think the format and topics covered were appropriate.

Recommend expanding upon the restaurant example or something similar early on so
it can be used when tweaking the other lessons.

If we have a similar mix of experience of students, I recommend letting the
accepted students know that they will be utilizing Python and to go to
[learnpython.org](http://learnpython.org) to run through lessons prior to the course commencing to
familiarize themselves with it

###Individual course recommendations

Overview
:	Have all instructors up at the front of the room for introductions and fielding ice breaker questions

Python Variables and Functions, the Basics
:	Need to include PyCharm and GitHub familiarization and prior to this session
if they will be utilized for the basic coding examples
May need to convert to more of a refresher course if it moves to AIMS

Development Tools
:	see previous about re-arrangement to introduce PyCharm / git earlier

Flow Control
:	Good job and keep the examples

Software Requirements
:	Good topic and the stakeholder exercise which was a good ice breaker for teams and instructors

Python Variables and Functions, the Not-so-Basics
:	Continue to build on the restaurant theme and use the examples here

Testing
:	I think showing examples of testing in the restaurant theme to emphasize points

Debugging
: Good examples and glad it did not rely on PyCharm to find things

Effective OOP
:	Good example to have the students try to decide on what classes are necessary

Python IO
:	Examples filled time properly, but probably could try more specific ones, especially related to projects

Reuse
:	Might cover more of the libraries II info from the extra sessions in this topic

User Interfaces
:	Just need to stress up front that GUI will not be covered in the course
because they are complex and there is not enough time. Or replace a session
block with an overview of GUI

Distributed Computing and Parallel Python
:	Students a bit confused on the advanced topics, examples were good, but might
need to have an instructor involved with each group to ensure they understand
what they are to do

Warmups
: All were generally good

Open Sessions
: Databases
: Debugging and Multifile Projects
: Libraries II


###Logistics

Thought pre-departure checklist was good and the Force Protection Plan and
requirements were pretty well spelled out.  Worst issue was obtaining the
invitation letter in time, but easily addressed for future trips by reviewing
the actual Visa application.

Should stay at the Guest House rather than the dorms.  Dorms had no AC, linens
and pillows not provided, and a long walk to the classrooms and dining places,
as well as having spotty wireless. They were so large, there was no real benefit
for staying in the same location as the students, although obtaining access to
the tutor room for social events is still a good idea.

Need to have a better plan for exchanging currency.  They embassy closed at noon
even though we were told 1500.  Banks are generally not open on Saturday, and we
found out later that they no longer exchanged US dollars.  We needed to go to
the ForEx Bureau, which worked well although they had a slightly lower exchange
rate.  If Carl had not had quite a bit of money from the previous
year, it would have been tough getting through the weekend.  The MaxMart at the
Legon Mall would exchange small amounts of currency when you bought something.

Highly recommend finding some means of transportation such as authorizing taxis,
having a car and driver, etc.  Makes it easier to purchase bulk water and eat
outside of the Guest House, cafeteria and Tyme Out.

###Other comments

I do not think the use of GitHub, Markdown, and using jekyll to be able to view
presentations was beneficial to the students.  The majority of my time was spent
trying to figure those things out, and not on actual course content.

Additionally, several changes were made throughout the process, causing things
to not work or view properly, so there was a lot of frustration and time wasted
on my end trying to make things function again.  Not sure the students gained
any additional benefit by using this process over a more traditional means (ie
powerpoint).  Would recommend that instructors who are not familiar with the
Markdown, etc, have other means of generating their presentations.

Also several presentations were not completed and or smoothed over before we
left (I was guilty of this as well). Which made it difficult to look at each
others lectures and try to incorporate ideas or tie in the lessons to each
other.  Then with the poor wireless in the classroom, the possibility for \"lights
out\" it was difficult to commit changes quickly, sync to the local repository,
etc. Recommend future instructors keep in mind the screen in the classroom is
very small, so small font or lots of text is unreadable from the back of the
classroom.

It is good to keep the presentations available to students on their
computers so they can follow and read.

For socials, I think only 2 a week would be sufficient.  Movie night is a good
idea, but need to have movies downloaded before leaving the US since even wired
internet is very slow.  Game night was also a big hit.  Would not recommend the
cook out again since there really is no easy way to cook. Football was also fun,
but need to make sure there is a ball. The weekend trip is a great idea and went
well.
