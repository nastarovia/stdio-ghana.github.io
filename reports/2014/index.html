There was also indications of improvement in many smaller individual elements, which likely contributed to this overall success. However, many opportunities for further improvement remain and some of the changes proposed in response to issues with the pilot course had unforeseen downsides, mostly notably instructor accommodations.</p> <h2 id="personnel">Personnel</h2> <dl> <dt>US</dt> <dd>Carl A.

The days also included warm-up activities, and coached project work. Two sessions at the end of the course were open for students to request the topics.</p> <p>The sessions are available permanently under the <a href="http://stdio-ghana.github.io/sessions/2014/">Sessions -&gt; 2014</a> section.</p> <p>The software engineering topics were:</p> <ul> <li>Development Tools</li> <li>Software Requirements</li> <li>Testing</li> <li>Debugging</li> <li>Best Practices</li> <li>Effective OOP</li> <li>Reuse</li> <li>User Interfaces</li> <li>Distributed Computing</li> <li>Open Session: Debugging and Multifile Projects</li> <li>Open Session: Libraries II</li> </ul> <p>The language topics were:</p> <ul> <li>Python Variables and Functions, the Basics</li> <li>Flow Control</li> <li>Python Variables and Functions, the Not-so-Basics</li> <li>Python OOP</li> <li>Python IO</li> <li>Python + C++</li> <li>Parallel Python</li> <li>Open Session: Databases</li> </ul> <p>Several sessions addressed both language and engineering topics, and these lists are an inexact categorization.</p> <h2 id="student-projects">Student Projects</h2> <p>Based on the pilot course experience, we requested Dr. Abdulai identify candidate research work that we could organize the student projects around. Unfortunately, that proved impossible. However, he was able use his contacts to generate some interest based on hospital and clinic administration. We did not ultimately get actual project work for that area, but we were able to obtain actual materials and requirements.</p> <p>Of the initially ~35 students, 24 remained through the project demonstration stage, and most of those students attended most of the sessions.</p> <p>The student project repositories are available at:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/stdio-ghana/public-health-group">Public Health Reporting</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/stdio-ghana/laboratory-group">Laboratory Testing</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/stdio-ghana/pharmacy-group">Pharmacy</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/stdio-ghana/employee-group">Employee Management</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/stdio-ghana/patient-group">Patient Management</a></li> </ul> <p>All of the student groups demonstrated interactive use of their applications. These applications generally covered querying a datastore, user data entry, data validation and some basic administrative task.</p> <p>These applications, while simple, represented a well-grounded foundation in terms of what they did and how they worked. However, the groups also had uniformly poor code organization.</p> <h2 id="outcomes--lessons-learned">Outcomes / Lessons Learned</h2> <h3 id="student-perspective">Student Perspective</h3> <p>Student feedback was very passionate about the course, and overall positive.</p> <p>They particularly emphasized the benefits of practically-driven coursework, being forced to find answers on their own, and interacting with the instructors regularly and directly, both in the classroom and at the social events.</p> <p>There were a few notable issues.</p> <p>The students were very positive about the style of the course, though they found it initially difficult. One of the take-aways from the pilot course was that this mode was very unfamiliar to students. This year, we also learned based on discussion with both students and faculty that many computer science courses <em>do not involve programming</em>. Some students even claimed to have completed a major in computer science without having programmed, and faculty thought this was plausible. There are several hurdles that contribute to this situation:</p> <ul> <li>the computer science department does not have any dedicated infrastructure to support a lab-based class, let alone several running concurrently;</li> <li>the administrative units that manage computer labs on campus have incentives to not provision them for courses;</li> <li>the labs on campus are generally configured for non-programming computer tasks (<em>e.g.</em>, word processing, interacting with particular applications);</li> <li>even if lab space were available, the computer science department has limited power to set class sizes or enforce priority for majors, and enrollment is often 100-200 students;</li> <li>not all of the computer science faculty would be able to teach and grade a course with a substantial programming component</li> </ul> <p>As with the previous year, the students noted several challenges with logistics. The adjustments made for this course seemed to have had a substantially contributed to improved attendance. However, while the provisioning the residence hall seemed to improve attendance, the accommodations there probably precluded much outside-of-class learning. The hall was initially occupied by students having finished the previous academic term, but not yet departed, then high school students participating in a science competition, then high school students attended a big tent revival, where the tent was erected directly behind the hall. Rather than the expected mostly empty hall, they instead experienced a densely populated building, mostly occupied with people that did not have academic constraints, and with unreliable power and water.</p> <p>In the pilot course, the students were positive about the exposure to several programming languages, but requested more focus. The emphasis on one language this year was very well received, though they did request for more perspective on using that language to interact with other software tools (e.g., databases).</p> <h3 id="instructor-team">Instructor Team</h3> <p>From the instructor side, we noted that projects suffered substantially from both overly ambitious scope and group attendance. Some of the students had very limited programming background; some overcame that deficiency during the course, but some did not, and that made the engineering topics very difficult for them to appreciate.</p> <h2 id="summary-conclusions-from-feedback--observations">Summary Conclusions from Feedback &amp; Observations</h2> <p>TODO</p> <p>notes:</p> <ul> <li>lodging students in residence hall: appears to improve attendance / attrition</li> <li>otoh, lodging the instructors there as well doesn’t seem to be the right choice; less reliable infrastructure has made it difficult to do evening support work.</li> <li>getting lab space configured was very difficult, lab machines still have incomplete network access.</li> <li>many more students than anticipated; course requires lots of individual attention, so this proved problematic</li> <li>using the vm images was definitely the right approach. HOWEVER, need to pay more attention to making the right image. For example, should have put our program icons on task bar (and removed inane ones), double checked all the activities for installation of proper libraries, disabled updates (maybe; alt: found way to locally distribute any updates that came up during course)</li> </ul> <h2 id="plan-for-fy15">Plan for FY15</h2> <p>Go to AIMS instead. Focus more on scientific projects – prescreen from AIMS student projects needing some pipeline work / coordination with other tools? Plan will be to admit a few students each from AIMS partner institutions – preference for 3rd year, experience with Python. Base admission on ability to complete some initial exam. Since these admissions will be to AIMS from those institutes, rather from them to them, should reduce strange application issues.</p> <p>Course material will be adjusted to reduce Python basics, since that will be covered for AIMS students, and can be specified as pre-req for admitted students. First few days review code basics with "simple" problem – all the engineering work done, just in need of filling in implementation.</p> <p>Aim for 3 weeks?</p> <p>Still want to bring US students. Try to coordinate with UF math department?</p> <h2 id="specific-session-revisions">Specific Session Revisions</h2> <p>We plan to revise the language sessions in the following way:</p> <ul> <li>AIMS requests sessions on bioinformatics + GIS + supercomputing</li> <li>AIMS students will have known skill w/ Python, will need process to also get UG / UCC / KNUST students up to speed</li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
