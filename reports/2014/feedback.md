Students were asked to each provide one aspect of the course they liked,
and one aspect that they wished was different.

##The Good:

- structure of warmup, AM/PM sessions, project work
- practical aspects, especially non-programming ones (*e.g.*, stakeholder exercise mentioned a few times)
- positive criticisms from instructors
- group projects and hands-on during sessions
- warm-up sessions
- weekend class trip
- learning about python
- that a lot was covered in two weeks
- interaction with instructors
- felt confident that could get actual problem and provide a solution with Python
- focus on learning how to find answers rather than being told directly
- went from no previous experience in Python to feeling confident in attempting a longer program
- discussion of actual operation of computer at lower level was useful
- first time programmer: high level discussions like best practices, testing and debugging session were very useful


##The Bad:

- Too short: extend to 3-4 weeks (about even split on 3 vs 4, no one for keeping at 2 weeks)
- Might not use python in future
- Instructors talk to fast
- No AC in lab
- Want more hands on with projects
- long days, very packed, intense
- Too many topics; not enough time to get experience with them
- No GIS and its extensions
- Would like more notice that it is Python so they can practice in advance;
more info on slides to make it easier to revisit slides
- 9-5 is intensive; no time to practice lessons
- No/poor internet access in the dormatories; Lengthy walk from dorms to lab
- Not enough / long enough breaks between sessions (accustomed to more break)
- interfered with wrapping up semester (some students had final year projects to complete)
- Carl too serious (quote: \"Carl needs to smile more.\")
- No GUI material covered (More on the design of buttons, radial buttons, etc.).  Several
students mentioned this
- need small homework assignments
- Hectic; Too tired when they are back in the room to keep working (also due to conditions
available in dorms)
