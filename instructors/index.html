Recently, his work has focused on dengue, a mosquito-spread disease endemic in tropical regions and emerging in temperate countries, in an effort to understand its epidemic dynamics and how we should best use interventions that are only partially effective. Other interests include the role of complex social structure on epidemic dynamics, inferring immunodynamics from epidemic time series, and Bayesian parameterization of stochastic models. Tom received his PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied these in the context of influenza and network modeling.</p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
