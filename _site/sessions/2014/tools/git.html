Pros of formal language: powerful shorthand for common tasks, possible to build tools on top of that expression; cons: have to learn it, plenty of crappy implementations, and can get complicated for not-so common tasks</p> <p>Any version control tool you are likely to see searching for one provides few basic notions:</p> <ul> <li>what is the reference "thing"</li> <li>what is the current version of that thing</li> <li>what is the history leading up to the current thing</li> <li>who did what during that history</li> </ul> <p><code>git</code> provides one additional twist, <strong>alternative versions</strong>, and then tools to use them. The are some other implementation advantages, but that’s all under the hood.</p> </aside> </section> <section> <h2 id="serial-git">Serial Git</h2> <aside class="notes"> <p>Go over the notion of a linear version control. Point is to have people do "series" work, from multiple locations. Show that series work can still have "parallel" issues creep in.</p> <p>Steps:</p> <ul> <li>fork <a href="https://github.com/pearsonca/hellogit">hellogit</a> project</li> <li>have people make some series of changes, locally and remotely</li> <li>first local changes, then commit + push</li> <li>then remote changes (via web interface) and commit (with insta-push)</li> <li>then local changes (pre pull) and show conflicts resolution</li> <li>have people share commit access, do some changes to the same thing at the same time, show collisions</li> </ul> </aside> </section> <section> <h2 id="parallel-git">Parallel Git</h2> <aside class="notes"> <p>The problems are typical to doing actual work, and are really a byproduct of the typical series / parallel problem. Activity is to highlight how <code>git</code> address parallel "problem": branches.</p> <ul> <li>a branch represents parallel work</li> <li>like parallel computation, best when shared state can be avoided</li> <li>how to avoid that kind of shared state? that’s a long discussion - the point of a software engineering course</li> </ul> <p>Activities:</p> <ul> <li>using forks from previous work, initiate pull requests</li> <li>need some pulls that can be unproblematically parallel</li> <li>ask participants to work together to create commits they think will cause conflicts</li> <li>use these to show merge resolution</li> </ul> <p>N.b.: branches don’t eliminate the need for resolving differences, but they make that activity its own "thing"</p> </aside> </section> <section> <h2 id="effective-habits">Effective Habits</h2> <aside class="notes"> <ul> <li>always start and end work with pull from / push to relevant branch</li> <li>before push, always pull from relevant branch (often enforced by <code>sync</code> if you use a GUI)</li> <li>commit, commit, commit</li> <li>afraid to commit b/c fiddling around, not sure, etc? branch, and then commit, commit, commit</li> <li>have everything you can either in the repository or as explicitly expressed dependency in the repo</li> </ul> </aside> </section> <section> <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2> <aside class="notes"> <ul> <li>first mantra: don’t panic - you are using distributed version control. practically impossible to destroy work unless you set out to destroy work</li> <li>ways to avoid troubleshooting: use the habits we just discussed</li> <li>if you didn’t: easiest sol’n duplicate the stuff you’re trying to hold on to</li> <li>rewind the source until it isn’t screwed, possibly copying out anything that needs to be preserved</li> <li>careful cut and paste back from the duplicated stuff back into what you have</li> </ul> </aside> </section> <section> <h2 id="organizing-with-github">Organizing with Github</h2> <aside class="notes"> <p>Github is not version control. It offers version control. Additionally, it offers work organization tools and GUIs:</p> <ul> <li>issues - things that need to be done / fixed / etc; can be assigned to individuals</li> <li>milestones - collections of issues</li> </ul> <p>separate from version control aspect, but VC aware. Can use commit messages to link issue resolution with particular commit / pull request.</p> </aside> </section> </div></div> <script>Reveal.initialize({controls:true,progress:true,history:true,center:true,theme:Reveal.getQueryHash().theme,transition:Reveal.getQueryHash().transition||"default",dependencies:[{src:"http://stdio-ghana.github.io/js/classList.js",condition:function(){return !document.body.classList}},{src:"http://stdio-ghana.github.io/js/notes.js",async:true,condition:function(){return !!document.body.classList}}]});</script> </body> </html>
