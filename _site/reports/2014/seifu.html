There are plenty of things we would do better if we taught it again.</p> <h3 id="sessions-i-thought-went-well">Sessions I thought went well:</h3> <ul> <li>basics - however, we needed an introduction to GitHub and PyCharm BEFORE any syntax session.</li> <li>best practices</li> <li>debugging</li> <li>flow control</li> <li>pyoop</li> <li>requirements</li> <li>userx</li> <li>distributed programming</li> <li>testing</li> </ul> <h3 id="sessions-i-think-need-improvement">Sessions I think need improvement:</h3> <dl> <dt>advanced</dt> <dd>this is only the second time students typed code. Do NOT take their knowledge for granted. Reduce the exercises and have help from more instructors.</dd> <dt>pycpp</dt> <dd>I wonder if this session can be shortened to 1 hour to provide students more time for in-class project work.</dd> <dt>pyio</dt> <dd>the students struggled and the instructors were not paying attention enough to help.</dd> <dt>pymp</dt> <dd>Well presented but quite advanced. See pycpp.</dd> <dt>reuse</dt> <dd>I think this should come later in the course and have examples of libraries in python that cover the "additional" session requested by students.</dd> <dt>tools</dt> <dd>this needs to be FIRST. Also, we provided many tools. I think "cheat sheets" would have helped the students substantially.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="logistical-issues">Logistical Issues</h2> <p>I did not have any issues participating in this program as a civilian instructor. Some other notes:</p> <ul> <li>The Guest Centre is preferable lodging to the dormitories because black-outs and water shortages were common in the dorm. Additionally, it has a back-up generator, more reliable internet, and air conditioning.</li> <li>Game night was a large success.</li> <li>We had socials most nights. Everyone enjoyed these events. I think we may want to have two fewer socials to give the instructors/students a bit of a break.</li> <li>There were some instructor-team communication issues pre- and during the trip. Some related to technical items, some philosophical. In a few instances, these issues bordered on interfering with delivering the course.</li> <li>The use of GitHub was not a challenge for the students</li> <li>The use of GitHub was a large challenge for instructors. The next time around it will be a lot smoother. I strongly recommend that all instructors are mandated to run identical installations of the operating system on their personal machines from the beginning. This was the largest hurdle. I edited my content from 3 different machines [windows 7 desktop (lab), windows 7 laptop (personal), linux mint 15 desktop (personal)] and all three machines required different tweaks, commands, etc to access and modify content. I estimate that I spent at least an equivalent amount of time trying to access the course content as I spent developing course content. If I could do it again from scratch, like all research, I would do it 2 to 5 times faster. Ultimately, I do not think GitHub needs to be removed from the course but I think the instructors, from the onset, should be more standardized on their approach.</li> <li>PyCharm was an invaluable tool for the students; however, the instructors did not adequately convey the power of the IDE (VCS integration, debugging, refactoring, etc). This was by design.</li> <li>Content (specifically, examples) were created in Ghana during other sessions. This made it so not all instructors were knowledgable of solutions and could not help students work through examples.</li> <li>The instructors were not involved enough in the project work keeping the students from going down rabbit holes in their code.</li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
